# The Purpose

I started my journey as a web developer in 2014. It was both a good and bad time to pick up web development. Good because there were a lot of battle tested platforms out there as well as many new things popping up everyday. Bad because there were too many options to choose from. Too many things to learn first before I can start building my first successful web app.

In 2019, the speed of progression has not slowed down and becoming faster and faster. But now there are a lot more tutorial and resources available to guide new ones in path of being a successful web developer.

The purpose of this gitbook is to summarize what I have learned over the year as a web developer, and guide beginners to start doing their own web development.
